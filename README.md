# Beach Volleyball Match Data

This repository contains **most** beach volleybal men's and women's match data from the AVP & FIVB tours between 2000 and Aug 2017.

**Some notes:**

The player names have been sorted alphabetically for a winning or losing team. This means that "Nick Lucena" should always appear in "w_player1" and "Phil Dalhauser" will appear in "w_player2".

w_rank and l_rank follow the convention "rank or seed, qualifier". If players have individual seeds (eg. in King of Beach), only the second players seeding is retained at the time of the data pull, but before the players have been sorted alphabetically. This means that for these matches, the seeding may not correspond to the correct player.
