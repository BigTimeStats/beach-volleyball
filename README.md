# Beach Volleyball Match Data and Statistics

This repository contains **most** beach volleyball men's and women's match data and match statistics from the AVP & FIVB tours. Archive contains matches from September 2000 to July 2017. Updated files published periodically with match dates in filenames.

**Notes:**

Date represents tournament date and is typically the first day of the tournament.

The winning team is denoted by "w_" and the losing team is denoted by "l_". 

The player names have been sorted alphabetically for a winning or losing team. This means that "Nick Lucena" should always appear in "w_player1" and "Phil Dalhausser" should appear in "w_player2".

Age is represented in years and is calculated as: (event date - birthdate) / 365.25, rounded to 7 decimals.

Height is represented in inches.

"W_rank" and "l_rank" follow the convention "seed, qualifier". If players have individual seeds (e.g. in King of Beach), only the second players seeding is retained at the time of the data pull, but before the players have been sorted alphabetically. This means that for these matches, the seeding may not correspond to the correct player.

Duration is represented as "h:mm".

Match stats (columns 34:65) represent match totals. Available for Contender's Bracket and above for about 20 FIVB and most AVP tournaments. "Hitpct" represents (kills - errors) / attacks.
