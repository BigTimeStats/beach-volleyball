This repository contains *most* beach volleybal men's and women's match data from the FIVB tour between January 2013 and July 2017.

Some notes:

The team names have been cleaned (some special chars remain) and sorted. 
"Sorting" means that a team will always appear based on the alphabetic sorting of the player names. For example, Dalhauser/Lucena will not appear as Lucena/Dalhauser. All teams have been standardized in this way.

The dataset variable is used to better identify where the data came from. Note that in dataset 2, ranking is missing (future update) and the round names are different. The round names are consistent within a tournament, and generally the lowest number pool corresponds to A, the next lowest number to B, etc.

Tournament type is based on FIVB designation

The score will indicate which team won. It should be read from left to right. For example, "21-19 21-19" signifies team_a won vs. "19-21 19-21" signifies team_b won.
