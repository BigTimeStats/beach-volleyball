This repository contains **most** beach volleybal men's and women's match data from the FIVB tour between January 2013 and July 2017.

**Some notes:**

The team names have been cleaned (some special chars remain) and sorted. 
*"Sorting"* means that a team will always appear based on the alphabetic sorting of the player names. For example, Dalhauser/Lucena will not appear as Lucena/Dalhauser. All teams have been standardized in this way.

The **dataset** variable is used to better identify where the data came from. Note that in dataset 2, ranking is missing (future update) and the **round** names are different. The round names are consistent within a tournament, and generally the lowest number pool corresponds to A, the next lowest number to B, etc.

The **score** will indicate which team won. It should be read from left to right. For example, "21-19 21-19" signifies team_a won vs. "19-21 19-21" signifies team_b won.

Tournament type is based on FIVB designation:

WCH=World Championship, GS=Grand Slam, MJS = Major Series, WTF = World Tour Finals, WT5*=World Tour 5 Stars, WT4*=World Tour 4 Stars,  etc., SAT=Satellite, CHAL=Challenger, MST=Master, CCH=Continental Championship, NT = National Tour, U19 = Under 19, 


AVP matches coming soon.
